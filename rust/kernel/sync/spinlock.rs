/// Exposes the kernel's [`spinlock_t`]. When multiple CPUs attempt to lock the same spinlock, only
/// one at a time is allowed to progress, the others will block (spinning) until the spinlock is
/// unlocked, at which point another CPU will be allowed to make progress.
///
/// A [`SpinLock`] must first be initialised with a call to [`SpinLock::init_lock`] before it can be
/// used. The [`spinlock_init`] macro is provided to automatically assign a new lock class to a
/// spinlock instance.
///
/// There are two ways to acquire the lock:
///  - [`SpinLock::lock`], which doesn't manage interrupt state, so it should be used in only two
///    cases: (a) when the caller knows that interrupts are disabled, or (b) when callers never use
///    it in atomic context (e.g., interrupt handlers), in which case it is ok for interrupts to be
///    enabled.
///  - [`SpinLock::lock_irqdisable`], which disables interrupts if they are enabled before
///    acquiring the lock. When the lock is released, the interrupt state is automatically returned
///    to its value before [`SpinLock::lock_irqdisable`] was called.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use kernel::prelude::*;
/// # use kernel::sync::SpinLock;
/// # use core::pin::Pin;
///
/// struct Example {
///     a: u32,
///     b: u32,
/// }
///
/// // Function that acquires spinlock without changing interrupt state.
/// fn lock_example(value: &SpinLock<Example>) {
///     let mut guard = value.lock();
///     guard.a = 10;
///     guard.b = 20;
/// }
///
/// // Function that acquires spinlock and disables interrupts while holding it.
/// fn lock_irqdisable_example(value: &SpinLock<Example>) {
///     let mut guard = value.lock_irqdisable();
///     guard.a = 30;
///     guard.b = 40;
/// }
