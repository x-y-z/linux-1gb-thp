//! A reference-counted pointer.
//!
//! This module implements a way for users to create reference-counted objects and pointers to
//! them. Such a pointer automatically increments and decrements the count, and drops the
//! underlying object when it reaches zero. It is also safe to use concurrently from multiple
//! threads.
//!
//! It is different from the standard library's [`Arc`] in two ways: it does not support weak
//! references, which allows it to be smaller -- a single pointer-sized integer; it allows users to
//! safely increment the reference count from a single reference to the underlying object.
//!
