	  Control LPC firmware cycle mappings through ioctl()s. The driver
	  also provides a read/write interface to a BMC ram region where the
	  host LPC read/write region can be buffered.

	  Provides a driver to control the LPC snoop interface which
	  allows the BMC to listen on and save the data written by
	  the host to an arbitrary LPC I/O port.

	  Control ASPEED P2A VGA MMIO to BMC mappings through ioctl()s.  The
	  driver also provides an interface for userspace mappings to a
	  pre-defined region.

	help
	  Enable support for the XDMA Engine found on the ASPEED BMC
	  SoCs. The XDMA engine can perform PCIe DMA operations between the BMC
	  and a host processor.
